# Clothing-Recognition-App
This project is a **fashion discovery application** where the **core functionality** revolves around AI/ML-based image processing. Users can upload or capture an image of a clothing item, after which the system:

1. **Removes the background or person/model.**
2. **Isolates and extracts the clothing item.**
3. **Analyzes the image to identify key features (type, color, pattern, style).**
4. **Searches a fashion product database for visually and semantically similar clothing items.**

## **AI/ML Component (Primary Focus)**

### 1. **Image Background/Person Removal**
- **Libraries/Models:**  
  - [Remove.bg API](https://www.remove.bg/api) (Quick integration)  
  - **U^2-Net** or **MODNet** (open-source background/personal removal models)  
  - **MediaPipe Selfie Segmentation** (for mobile)  

- **Process:**
  - Input: Raw image from user.
  - Output: Image with either **transparent background** or **isolated clothing region**.

- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Preprocess: Resize image, normalize pixels.
  - Segment using trained model (or API).
  - Apply mask to remove background/person.

---

### 2. **Clothing Item Extraction and Feature Detection**
- **Goal:** Identify type, category, pattern, color, and fabric.
- **Tools/Models:**
  - **FashionNet**, **DeepFashion2** pretrained models.
  - CNN-based classifier for **category** (top, jeans, jacket, etc.).
  - **Color histogram** or **K-Means** for dominant color.
  - **ResNet + custom head** for feature vector extraction.

- **Process:**
  1. Crop the clothing item from the segmented image.
  2. Feed it to a feature extractor (CNN-based).
  3. Store resulting feature vector and attributes.

- **Extracted Features:**
  - Clothing type (T-shirt, blouse, dress)
  - Dominant color (RGB or name mapped via clusters)
  - Texture/Pattern (plain, floral, striped)
  - Style (casual, formal, sportswear)

---

### 3. **Clothing Matching Algorithm**
- **Similarity Search Approaches:**
  - Cosine similarity between **feature embeddings**.
  - Use **FAISS** for fast vector similarity search.
  - Optionally use **ANN (Approx. Nearest Neighbor)** for scalable retrieval.

- **Database:**
  - MongoDB to store image metadata + extracted features.
  - Clothing Item Schema:  
    ```json
    {
      "image_url": "...",
      "category": "jacket",
      "color": "black",
      "features": [0.12, 0.38, ..., 0.67]
    }
    ```
    
- **Search Pipeline:**
  - Extract features from user image.
  - Compare with database items.
  - Return top-N similar clothing items.
---

### 4. **Optional: Complementary Fashion Recommendations**
- Use **style classification** to determine the outfit style.
- Implement rule-based or ML-based suggestions (e.g., if top is formal, suggest formal pants or shoes).
- Use a trained **fashion compatibility model** (such as the one from Polyvore dataset).

---

## Full Stack System Overview (Secondary) (Under Development)
### **Frontend (React Native)**
- Capture/upload photo interface.
- Preview and crop image.
- Show extracted result and similar products.

## Summary
- The **primary emphasis is AI/ML**—handling clothing extraction, background removal, and finding similar items.
- Use **React Native** (frontend), **Express.js** (backend), and **MongoDB** (data).
- The ML system performs background removal, extracts clothing features using pre-trained CNNs, and finds matches from a product database.
- Additional optional features include fashion style compatibility and complementary item recommendation, along with combining components for a complete AI Clothing Recognition App.

## Future Scope
1. **Improved Segmentation**
- Upgrade to Advanced Models:
  - Replace basic models with U²-Net, MODNet, or DeepLabV3+ for superior boundary precision and hair/fabric detection.
  - Edge Quality & Smoothing:
  - Implement edge-aware loss functions to reduce jagged or pixelated segmentation, enhancing clothing outline clarity.
- Alpha Matting & Blending:
  - Incorporate alpha matting techniques for semi-transparent clothing (e.g., lace, chiffon).
  - Apply alpha blending for smoother transitions between foreground (clothes) and background when replacing or modifying backgrounds.
- Black Blur / Edge Bleed Fix:
  - Remove undesired black halos or blurry outlines by:
  - Fine-tuning post-processing
  - Applying matting refinement
  - Using Trimap-guided blending

2. **Real Clothing Database (Beyond DummyDB)**
-  Use Vector-Based Similarity Search:
  - Implement FAISS, Pinecone, or Weaviate to store high-dimensional image embeddings for rapid similarity search.
-  Rich Metadata Storage:
  - Store additional details:
    - Brand
    - Season
    - Fabric type
    - Target audience
    - Color palette
    - Formality level
- Auto-tagging pipeline using ML models to auto-populate metadata from clothing images.

3. **Advanced Feature Extraction**
- CNN-Based Texture Features:
  - Shift from traditional LBP/GLCM to deep texture embeddings using pretrained CNNs like ResNet, EfficientNet, or Swin Transformer.
-  Attribute Detection:
  - Detect:
    - Clothing category (e.g., "skater skirt", "bomber jacket")
    - Color (e.g., Pantone mapping)
    - Pattern (e.g., stripes, floral)
    - Style (e.g., streetwear, formal)

4. **Integration of the Halo Effect**
-  Perceptual Tagging System:
  -  Use annotated datasets to train models that associate clothing with emotional and psychological perceptions (confidence, professionalism, elegance, etc.).
- User-Facing Labels:
  - After processing, each recommended item could include tags like:
    - "Modern & bold"
    - "Soft & approachable"
    - "Professional & clean"
- Personal Branding Engine:
  - Let users select a target perception and match items accordingly.
  - Could be driven via multi-modal AI (image + text).

5.**Web Interface for Real-Time Interaction**
- Streamlit or Flask Frontend:
  - Enable drag-and-drop or mobile uploads
  - Display:
    - Segmented clothing
    - Recommended items with perception tags
    - Option to save & share results
- Real-Time Preview:
  - Live updates during segmentation
  - Toggle between different background removal modes (solid color, fashion ramp, etc.)

6. **Performance Optimizations**
- GPU Acceleration:
  - Run segmentation + feature extraction in batches using GPU via TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- On-Device Inference:
  - Convert models to TensorFlow Lite or ONNX for use in React Native mobile deployment.
- Parallel Background Tasks:
  - Async processing pipeline to avoid UI lag.
- Caching and CDNs:
  - Cache segmented results and thumbnails for faster retrieval and display.

7. **Clothing Parsing Model Integration**
- Fine-Grained Garment Segmentation:
  - Integrate a specialized clothing parsing model trained on datasets like ModaNet, DeepFashion, or LIP for pixel-wise segmentation of individual garments.
  - Identify distinct regions such as shirts, trousers, shoes, jackets, and accessories within a single image.
- Category-Level Classification:
  - Go beyond "person vs. background" segmentation by labeling semantic clothing parts for detailed tagging and analysis.
  - Enable fashion-specific taxonomy (e.g., "off-shoulder top", "maxi dress", "canvas sneakers").
- Enhanced Matching & Recommendations:
  - Use segmented clothing regions to improve feature extraction per item (shape, style, position).
  - Enable better retrieval of visually and functionally similar garments from the database.
-  Multi-Class Parsing Pipelines:
  - Use models capable of multi-class segmentation masks that differentiate and label multiple clothing pieces per person.
  - Combine with classification heads for enhanced scene understanding.

## Next Steps & Suggestions
1. **System recommends complementary fashion pieces**
   - e.g., shoes, accessories, outfits).
2. **Prototype AI/ML Pipeline:**
   - Use Colab to prototype `remove_bg`, `extract_features`, and `match_items`.
3. **Prepare Dataset:**
   - Use **DeepFashion** or scrape e-commerce data for training and testing.
4. **Deploy Feature Search:**
   - Try **FAISS** locally for high-performance similarity search.
5. **Integrate with Backend:**
   - Wrap the ML logic in Express routes (e.g., `/process-image`, `/match-items`).
